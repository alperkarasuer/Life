# Conway's Game of Life in Python

This project is a personal exploration into implementing Conway's Game of Life using Python. I've brought it to life (pun intended) using numpy for the calculations and pygame for the graphical display. It was crafted over a weekend, blending fun with a bit of coding challenge.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To ensure compatibility, please install the specific versions of numpy and pygame:

```bash
pip install numpy==1.23.2 pygame==2.1.2
```

### Running the Game
To get the game up and running:
```bash
python main.py
```

## How To Play

* **Setup:** Click on cells to toggle their state between alive or dead.
* **Randomize:** Press **`R`** to fill the board with a random pattern.
* **Start:** Hit **`Enter`** to kick off the simulation and see how the cells evolve.
* **Step Mode**: To closely observe the evolution step by step, press `S`. In this mode, every press of `S` advances the game by one step, allowing for detailed observation of the cellular interactions. To exit step mode and resume normal continuous evolution, press `Enter` again.


## Built With
* Python
* Numpy
* Pygame
